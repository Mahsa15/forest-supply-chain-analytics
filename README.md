# Forest Supply Chain Analytics (SQL + Python + SQLite + BI Dashboard)

End-to-end portfolio project that shows how I build decision-support analytics:  
**generate data → load to SQLite → analyze with SQL → prepare insights → visualize in Power BI / Tableau**.

> **Use case:** planning + operations analytics for harvest-to-mill supply chain (KPI tracking, utilization, profitability, exceptions).

---

## What this project answers (Business Questions)
- Are we meeting the weekly plan (**planned vs. actual**)?
- Which mills are **under/over-utilized** vs capacity?
- Where is profit coming from (**mill / region / species**)?
- Which weeks have the biggest **shortfalls** (gap)?
- Which high-risk stands contribute most (exceptions monitoring)?

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas)
- **SQLite**
- **SQL** (joins, aggregations, quality checks)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (dashboard visualization)
